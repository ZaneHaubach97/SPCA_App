    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps: 
      # step 1, use Marketplace action called Checkout@v2, to checkout the code
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2 #'uses' keyword launches the Marketplace action
      # step 2, verbosely build the package using the `swift` CLI
    - name: Build
      run: swift build -v #'run' keyword executes the command, as if it's run in terminal
      # step 3, verbosely test the package using the `swift` CLI
    - name: Run tests
      run: swift test -v #'run' keyword executes the command, as if it's run in terminal
